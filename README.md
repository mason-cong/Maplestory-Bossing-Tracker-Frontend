## How It's Made:

**Tech used in frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS </br>
**Tech used in backend:** Java, Spring Boot 3 </br>

The frontend is built with React, using reusable components to keep the code clean and maintainable. Styling is handled with in-line CSS using Tailwind, and state management ensures smooth user interactions. It connects to the backend which is also hosted on Render
which features routes to create a user, create a character, and create bosses entities to assign to the character. it is wrriten using Java and Springboot handles the server management and database table creations.

## How To Run:

You can deploy the web page as a vite app using the command npm run dev on your local machine. To modify the API access routes, go to the service files that can be found under src/api.

## Lessons Learned:

This project gave me the opportunity to leverage the skills I learned creating an e-commerce site for my fourth-year university classes to create a complete full stack application that solves my problem of tracking income from characters in Maplestory.
